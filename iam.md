## IAM (Identity Access and Management)

The IAM infrastructure includes the following elements:

### Principal

* A principal is an entity that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. 
* Users, roles, federated users, and applications are all AWS principals. 
* Your AWS account root user is your first principal.
